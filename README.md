# Heart-Disease-Identification
This is my final year project based on heart disease identification using ensemble learning and deep learning
##### This work is improvised version for the IEEE paper  (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9122958 )
the dataset is taken from Machine learning UCI repository 
''' There is always need of analysis of heart related things either diagnosis or prediction or you cansay that protection of heart disease.There are various fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining that contributed on this work.''' 

This paper has used machine learning algorithms such as linear regression(78%), Decision tree regression (79%), K-nearest neighbor (87%), and Support vector machines (83%) on features data.

'''These algorithms are performed independently and are providing less accurate results. To overcome this we are going to apply a deep learning Technique i.e.
Artificial neural network and ensemble learning by random forest classifier and decision tree regression for better prediction and provide
best accurate results'''
